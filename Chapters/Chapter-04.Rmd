## Nonparametric Comparison of Survival  Distributions 

### Hypothesis test:

Interestingly, the log-rank statistic is identical to a classical test statistic from  epidemiology, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel test [2]. 
This is a test for independence  of two factors (here, treatment and outcome) adjusted for a potential confounder,  and is expressed as series of two-by-two tables with a time-stratified confounding  factor. 

The log-rank test may also be derived from the proportional hazards model,  as we will see in the next chapter. 

While these rank-based tests are similar to the Mann-Whitney test, the presence of  censoring complicates the assignment of ranks.

That is, for each failure time `ti` we may construct a two-by-two table showing the numbers at risk (`n0i` and `n1i` forthe control and treatment arms, respectively) and the number of failures (`d0i` and  `d1i`, respectively).

Then for the `i’th` failure time, we have the following table: 

![](Chapters/images/survival_testing.png)

`hypergeometric distribution`

This probability mass function allows one to compute  the probability of each possible table with the margins fixed.

We may sum up over all the tables the differences between the observed and  expected values to get a linear test statistic `U0`, and also the sum of the variances `V0` as follows,

This test is known as the *log-rank test*. The test is similar/identical to the the Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel where a test of independence by two factors (e.g. treatment and placebo) is done adjusted for a potential confounder.


## Example of testing

* 6 subjects, 3 in treatment and 3 in control.

* 4 survtimes => 4 times a 2x2 table

![](Chapters/images/testing_sample.png)

![](Chapters/images/2x2_tables_surv_test.png)

* sum(d0i) = 2
* sum(e01) = 1.083
* => U0 = 2 - 1.083 = 0.917
* => V0 (sum v0i) = 0.6579
* ==> log-rank stat (X2): U0 ^ 2 / V0 = 0.917 ^2 / 0.6579 = 1.27
* => Chi-square with 1 df

tt <- c(6, 7, 10, 15, 19, 25)

trt <- c(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1)
survdiff(Surv(tt, delta) ~ trt)

# pharmacoSmoking: time to relapse depending on age, factor, treatment etc

data(pharmacoSmoking) # attach includes the ttr variables etc
knitr::kable(pharmacoSmoking %>% head)

# combination or path only:
table(pharmacoSmoking$grp)

surv_ <- Surv(pharmacoSmoking$ttr,pharmacoSmoking$relapse)
str(surv_)
survdiff_ <- survdiff(surv_ ~ pharmacoSmoking$grp)
survfit_ <- survfit(surv_ ~ pharmacoSmoking$grp)

survdiff_
# Combination is best - significant difference
plot(survfit_,conf.int = F,col = c("blue","red")) 

# By age group as well
table(pharmacoSmoking$ageGroup2)
surv_ <- Surv(pharmacoSmoking$ttr,pharmacoSmoking$relapse)
survdiff_ <- survdiff(surv_ ~ pharmacoSmoking$grp + pharmacoSmoking$ageGroup2)
survfit_ <- survfit(surv_ ~ pharmacoSmoking$grp+ pharmacoSmoking$ageGroup2)
plot(survfit_,conf.int = F,col = c("blue","green","red","black")) 
survdiff_
survfit_

ggsurvplot(survfit_,data=pharmacoSmoking,conf.int = TRUE)
# Worst: patch only, young people - median 14
# Best: combo 50+ - median never reached, lower cl 75

## Exercises 

### Exercise 4.1

> Using the pharmacoSmoking data, compare the two treatments using the  Prentice modification of the Gehan test, and compare your results to those from  the log-rank test.  

```{r}

# By age group as well
table(pharmacoSmoking$ageGroup2)
surv_ <- Surv(pharmacoSmoking$ttr,pharmacoSmoking$relapse)
survdiff_ <- survdiff(surv_ ~ pharmacoSmoking$grp)
survdiff_Prentice <- survdiff(surv_ ~ pharmacoSmoking$grp,rho=1)
survdiff_
survdiff_Prentice

```


### Exercise 4.2. 

> Again using the pharmacoSmoking data, carry out a log-rank test comparing  the two treatments stratifying on employment status.  


```{r}

# By age group as well
surv_ <- Surv(pharmacoSmoking$ttr,pharmacoSmoking$relapse)
survdiff_ <- survdiff(surv_ ~ pharmacoSmoking$grp + pharmacoSmoking$employment)
survdiff_Prentice <- survdiff(surv_ ~ pharmacoSmoking$grp + pharmacoSmoking$employment,rho=1)
survdiff_
survdiff_Prentice

```

### Exercise 4.3. 

> Using the “pancreatic” data set, which has no censored observations, compare  the two groups using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, using the “wilcox.test” function  in base R. Compare your results to those from the log-rank and Prentice-modified  Gehan tests.  


```{r}

wilcox.test(time.progressionFreeSurvival~stage)

surv_ <- Surv(pancreatic$time.progressionFreeSurvival,pancreatic$status)
survdiff(surv_ ~ pancreatic$stage,rho=0)
survdiff(surv_ ~ pancreatic$stage,rho=1)

```

### Exercise 4.4. 

> Again using the “pancreatic” data set, compare the two groups using overall  survival as the outcome, using both the log-rank test and the Prentice modification  of the Gehan test. Do these two tests yield different results? 

```{r}

wilcox.test(time.progressionFreeSurvival~stage)

pancreatic_ = pancreatic %>% dplyr::mutate(OS = as.integer(difftime(death,onstudy,units="days")))

surv_ <- Surv(pancreatic_$OS,pancreatic_$status)
survdiff(surv_ ~ pancreatic$stage,rho=0)
survdiff(surv_ ~ pancreatic$stage,rho=1)

```
