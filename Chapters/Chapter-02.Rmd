## Survival function

![](Chapters/Chapters/images/surv_func.png)

Survival analysis methods depend on the survival distribution, and two key ways of  specifying it are the survival function and the hazard function. The survival function  defines the probability of surviving up to a point t. 

This function takes the value 1 at time 0, decreases (or remains constant) over time,  and of course never drops below 0. As defined here it is right continuous. 

```{r}



df.survival_function = data.frame(day=seq(365),
                                  prob=0.99^(seq(365)))

ggplot(df.survival_function,aes(x=day,y=prob)) +
  geom_line()

```


## Hazard function

![](Chapters/images/hazard_func.png)

The survival function is often defined in terms of the hazard function, which  is the instantaneous failure rate. It is the probability that, given that a subject has  survived up to time t, he or she fails in the next small interval of time, divided by  the length of that interval.

## Example: Survexp

```{r}

survexp.us[,,"2004"] %>% head

df.survexp_us.2004 = survexp.us[,,"2004"]

# Males
df.survexp_us.2004.male = 
  data.frame(age=as.integer(row.names(df.survexp_us.2004)),
           haz_male=as.numeric(df.survexp_us.2004[,1]))

ggplot(df.survexp_us.2004.male,aes(x=age,y=haz_male)) +
  geom_point()

# Females
df.survexp_us.2004.female = 
  data.frame(age=as.integer(row.names(df.survexp_us.2004)),
           haz_female=as.numeric(df.survexp_us.2004[,2]))

ggplot(df.survexp_us.2004.female,aes(x=age,y=haz_female)) +
  geom_point()

```

## Cumulative survival

Cumulative distribution function

This is the complement of the survival function and, like the survival function, it  is right continuous. In survival analysis, this function is known as the cumulative  risk function


![](Chapters/images/cum_survival.png)

## Cumulative Hazard Function

The cumulative hazard function is defined as the area under the hazard function up  to time t, that is, 

![](Chapters/images/cum_hazard_func.png)

## Survival Function to Hazard Function

![](Chapters/images/surv_func_to_hazard_func.png)

It is this relationship that allows us to compute the survival function corresponding  to a hazard function, as in Figs. 2.1 and 2.2. 

## Mean and median survival time

![](Chapters/images/eq_2_3.png)

Mean survival time if s(infinite) = 0, meaning that all fail at some point.
Also means that the Kaplan-Meier curve where the curve does not reach zero cannot be computed.

Median survival is when S(t) = 1/2. Undefined is never reaching <0.5.

## Distributions

### Parametric distributions (2.4)

### 1. Exponential distribution
Several survival distributions are available for modeling survival data. The exponential distribution, the simplest survival distribution, has a constant hazard, `h(t) = delta`. 

![](Chapters/images/cum_exp_distribution.png)
Survival function:
![](Chapters/images/eq_2_4_2.png)


```{r}

hazard=0.002

df.exponential =
  data.frame(time=seq(365),
             haz=hazard,
             survival=exp(-hazard*seq(365)),
             prob_dens=hazard*exp(-hazard*seq(365)))

# Constant hazard
ggplot(df.exponential,aes(x=time,y=haz)) +
  geom_point()

# Survival function
ggplot(df.exponential,aes(x=time,y=survival)) +
  geom_point()

# Probability density function
ggplot(df.exponential,aes(x=time,y=prob_dens)) +
  geom_point()

# Mean
1/hazard

# Median
exp(-hazard*346)
log(2)/hazard

```


### 2. Weibull distribution

The exponential distribution is easy to work with, but the constant hazard  assumption is not often appropriate for describing the lifetimes of humans or  animals. The Weibull distribution, which offers more flexibility in modeling survival  data,

![](Chapters/images/weibull_distribution.png)

Hazard function:

```{r}

alpha = 0.1
delta = 0.2
t = seq(365)

# Hazard
h_t = alpha*delta^alpha*t^(alpha-1)

# Survival
s_t = exp(-(delta*t)^alpha)

df.weibull = 
  data.frame(time=seq(365),
           hazard=h_t,
           survival=s_t)

ggplot(df.weibull,aes(x=time,y=hazard)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(df.weibull,aes(x=time,y=survival)) +
  geom_point()

## Similarity to exponential when alpha=1
alpha = 1
delta = 0.2
t = seq(365)
h_t = alpha*delta^alpha*t^(alpha-1)
s_t = exp(-(delta*t)^alpha)

df.weibull = 
  data.frame(time=seq(365),
           hazard=h_t,
           survival=s_t)

ggplot(df.weibull,aes(x=time,y=hazard)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(df.weibull,aes(x=time,y=survival)) +
  geom_point()

## Gamma > 1, monotone increasing
alpha = 2
delta = 0.2
t = seq(365)
h_t = alpha*delta^alpha*t^(alpha-1)
s_t = exp(-(delta*t)^alpha)

df.weibull = 
  data.frame(time=seq(365),
           hazard=h_t,
           survival=s_t)

ggplot(df.weibull,aes(x=time,y=hazard)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(df.weibull,aes(x=time,y=survival)) +
  geom_point()

## Gamma < 1, monotone increasing
alpha = 0.2
delta = 0.2
t = seq(365)
h_t = alpha*delta^alpha*t^(alpha-1)
s_t = exp(-(delta*t)^alpha)

df.weibull = 
  data.frame(time=seq(365),
           hazard=h_t,
           survival=s_t)

ggplot(df.weibull,aes(x=time,y=hazard)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(df.weibull,aes(x=time,y=survival)) +
  geom_point()

```

#### Mean and median Weibull

```{r}

# Mean
gamma(1+1/alpha)/delta

# Median
log(2)^(1/alpha)/delta

```

#### Weibull functions in R

```{r}
dweibull(x = c(0.25,0.75),shape=c(0.5,0.5))

# Plotting a Weibull survival curve
weibSurv <- function(t, shape, scale) pweibull(t, 
                                               shape=shape,
                                               scale=scale,

               scale=1/0.03), # 1/gamma
      from=0,
      to=150,
      ylim=c(0,1), 
      ylab="Survival probability", 
      xlab="Time")  

# Plotting Weibull hazard curve (as well)
weibHaz <- function(x, shape, scale) dweibull(x, shape=shape,  scale=scale)/pweibull(x, shape=shape, scale=scale,  lower.tail=F) 

curve(weibHaz(x,
              shape=1.5,
              scale=1/0.03),
      from=0,
      to=150,
      ylab="Hazard", 
      xlab="Time",
      col="red",
      add = T)  



```

```{r}

set.seed(2511)
alpha <- 1.5
gamma <- 0.03

### Compute random weibull variables
weibull_variables <- rweibull(n = 1000,shape=alpha,scale=1/gamma)
weibull_variables[c(1:10)]
### Aggregate on those
mean(weibull_variables)
median(weibull_variables)

## Theoretical mean and median
gamma(1+(1/alpha))/gamma
(log(2)^(1/alpha))/gamma # natural log

```

### Gamma distribution

It is monotone increasing for beta>1 and  monotone decreasing for beta<1. When beta=1, the gamma distribution reduces to  an exponential distribution.  

The hazard and survival functions cannot be written in closed form.

# shape: alpha
# scale: 1/delta

### Gamma hazard
gammaHaz <- { function(x, 
                       shape, 
                       scale) dgamma(x,

                                                         scale=scale, 
                                                         lower.tail=F) } 

curve(gammaHaz(x, shape=c(alpha), scale=1/gamma), from=0, to=150,  ylab="Hazard", xlab="Time", col="red")

curve(gammaHaz(x, shape=c(0.75), scale=1/gamma), from=0, to=150,  ylab="Hazard", xlab="Time", col="red",add=TRUE)  

```


### Integral way of reproducing the survival function

```{r}

# Survival rates at different ages

tm <- c(0, # birth
          1/365, # first day
          7/365,  # 7. day
          28/365, # 4. week
          1:107) # subsequent year

# Hazard lookup from the survexp
hazMale <- survexp.us[,"male","2004"] # use 3d matrix to isolate males in 2004
hazFemale <- survexp.us[,"female","2004"] # use 3d matrix to isolate females in 2004

diff(c(1,3)) # how diff works
tm[c(1:5)] # the tm vector
tm.diff <- diff(tm)
tm.diff # the tm diff vector

# Compute survivals
survMale <- exp(-cumsum(hazMale*tm.diff)*365.24) # rates are constant at different ages
survFemale <- exp(-cumsum(hazFemale*tm.diff)*365.24)   # rates are constant at different ages

# Mean survival
survMale*tm.diff[c(1:10)]
sum(survMale*tm.diff)
sum(survFemale*tm.diff)



```


### Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Mathematical framework for computing gamma when you have a series of observations t1, t2, t3 etc

We construct a  likelihood by taking a product of terms from the exponential distribution, one for  each observation.
f(t1*GAMMA)

We need to find the value of GAMMA that maximizes this function, and that  value is known as the maximum likelihood estimate. Now, this product formula is  difficult to work with, so we use a logarithmic transformation to convert it into a  sum, known as the log-likelihood,  

Person years:
![](Chapters/images/2_6_person_years.png)

![](Chapters/images/mle_var.png)
![](Chapters/images/mle_table.png)

Consider for example the six observations in Table 1.1, and suppose that they  are derived from an exponential distribution with unknown parameter GAMMA. 
There  are three deaths, which gives us d `d = 3`. 
Also, the total patient time on study is  `V = 7+6+6+5+2+4 = 30`. 
The log-likelihood function is `l(gamma) = 3 * log(gamma) - 30 * gamma`,  and the maximum likelihood estimate is given by `gammaHat = 3/30 / 0.1`

```{r}

ml_function = function(d,V,gamma)  {
    return(d*log(gamma)-30*gamma)
}

gamma_df = data.frame(gamma=seq(0,1,by=0.001),
           gamma_=ml_function(3,30,seq(0,1,by=0.001)))

ggplot(gamma_df,aes(x=gamma,y=gamma_)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.1)

gamma_optimal = 3 / ( 7+6+6+5+2+4)
gamma

```

##  Exercises

```

### 2.4

> Consider the survival data in Exercise 1.1. Assuming that these observations  are from an exponential distribution, find GAMMA-hat  and an estimate of var(GAMMAhat)

```{r}

df.ex_1_1 =  data.frame(id=seq(5),
                        survTime=c(5,5,4,3,1),
                        event=c(0,0,1,1,1))

d = sum(df.ex_1_1$event==1)
V = sum(df.ex_1_1$survTime)

# Maximum likelihood
deltaHat = d/V
deltaHat

# Variance of the mle
varDeltaHat = deltaHat^2/d
varDeltaHat


```

### 2.5
 
> Consider a survival distribution with constant hazard DELTA = 0.07 from t=0  until t=5 and then hazard DELTA = 0.14 for t > 5. (This is known as a PIECEWISE CONSTANT HAZARD) Plot this hazard function and the corresponding survival function  for 0 < t < 10. What is the median survival time?  

```{r}
# 2.5. 

df.2_5 = 
  bind_rows(
data.frame(t=seq(0,4.9,by=0.1),
           H=seq(0,4.9,by=0.1)*0.07),
data.frame(t=seq(5,10,by=0.1),
           H=seq(5,10,by=0.1)*0.14)
) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(S=exp(-H*t))

# Hazard
ggplot(df.2_5,aes(x=t,y=H)) + 
  geom_line()

# Survival
ggplot(df.2_5,aes(x=t,y=S)) +

# Median



```

### 2.6

> Another parametric survival distribution is the log-normal distribution. Use the  density and cumulative distribution R functions “dlnorm” and “plnorm” to compute  and plot the lognormal hazard functions with the parameter “meanlog” taking the  values 0, 1, and 2, and with “sdlog” fixed at 0.25. Describe the risk profile a disease 

```{r}

plot(
dlnorm(x = seq(0,100),
       meanlog = c(0),
       sdlog = 0.25)
)


plot(
dlnorm(x = seq(0,100),
       meanlog = c(1),
       sdlog = 0.25)
)

plot(
dlnorm(x = seq(0,100),
       meanlog = c(2),
       sdlog = 0.25)
)



```
